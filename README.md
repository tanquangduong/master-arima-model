Master ARIMA model for forcasting


## âœ… Setup Env
- Create Python environment\
`conda create -n env_name python=3.10`\
`conda activate env_name`
- Create Python environment\
`pip install -r .\path_to_requirements\requirements.txt`

## Time series
- Properties:
  - Trend: positive/negative trend is a line the generally slope up/down
  - Seasionality: patterns that repeat at regular intervals
  - Cyclicality: repeating pattern but no fixed period
  - Noise: the current value is not relevant to value that came before
  - Stationary: 
    - Distribution of the data doesn't change with time. 
    - The variance is constant 
    - Autocorrelation is constant
- Test non-stationary: Dicky-Fuller test
  - Tests for trend non-stationarity
  - Null hypothesis is that time-series is non-stationary
  - Oth element is test statistic: More negative means more likely to be stationary
  - 1st element is p-value: if p-value is small -> reject null hypothesis. Reject non-stationary
- Time series models
  - AR: Auto Regressive model
  - MA: Moving Average model
  - ARMA: AR + MA
  - ARIMA
- Autocorrelation
  - ACF
  - PACF
- AIC and BIC
  - AIC: Akaike information criterion
  - BIC - Bayesian information criterion
  - Lower AIC/BIC - better model
  - AIC/BIC like Simple models with lower order
  - BIC favors simpler models than AIC
- Box-Jenkins
  - Identification
    - Is the time series stationary?
    - What differencing will make it stationary
    - What transforms will make it stationary
    - What values of p and q are the most promissing
  - Estimation
    - Use the data to train the model coefficients
    - Done for us using model.fit()
    - Choose between models using AIC and BIC
  - Model diagnostic
    - Are the residual uncorrelated
    - Are residual normally distributed
      - results.plot_diagnostics()
      - results.summary()
  - Seasonal time series
    - Seasonal data
      - Has predictable and repeated patterns
      - Repeat after any amount of time
